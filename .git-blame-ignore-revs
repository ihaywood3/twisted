# This file lists commits that should be ignored by the `git blame` command.
# You can configure your checkout to use it by default by running:
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Or pass it to the blame command manually:
#
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs ...
#
# Note that these features require Git 2.23 (released August 2019).
